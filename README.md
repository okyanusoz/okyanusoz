### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Okyanus. 

I'm a web developer that strongly believes in the Web. In my opinion, the Web has great potential.

My favorite languages and frameworks are:
- JS for quick frontends
- TypeScript + Next.js for complex apps
- Python for basic scripting and ML

I also believe in open source. I think there's a lot to learn from production software.

Happy browsing!
